olely developed and deployed a real-time, production-grade Generative AI document processing backend under the clientâ€™s domain, leveraging Azure OpenAI, NLP, and computer vision techniques. Built a single unified codebase capable of dynamically extracting all document sections, requiring only prompt adjustments for new document types. Enhanced the system with post-processing archival, logging (local + database), and secure key management via Azure Key Vault. Automated output storage in Azure Blob Storage, integrated into a CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps. Implemented a confidence scoring mechanism (>95%) for extracted fields, with a fallback workflow that enables users to manually review and update results through a dedicated frontend interface supporting bulk updates and document reviews. The solution is live in production for healthcare/insurance use cases, including Invoices and CMS1500 forms, for a major U.S. insurance client.
