1. Preserve ALL values exactly as they appear - DO NOT remove duplicates.
2. Merge ALL values (including identical ones) using ";" separator.
3. Merge line items so each line appears once.
4. Do not lose any information.
5. Do not duplicate information unnecessarily.
6. Use EXACT SAME column names as input.
7. Output must be VALID JSON ONLY.
8. Output must represent ONE consolidated row.
9. Consider numeric sequences before merging values; ensure numbers are preserved in order.
10. Use ";" to separate ALL values, keeping every occurrence including duplicates.
11. If a value includes both a date and timestamp (e.g., "11/25/2025;11/25/2025 3:03:47 PM"),
    evaluate the header/context of the column to determine the appropriate format:
    - Use date-only format (e.g., "11/25/2025") if timestamp is unnecessary for the context.
    - Retain full date-time format (e.g., "11/25/2025 3:03:47 PM") if timestamp is relevant to the column's purpose.
12. Omit values such as "N/A" or "N/A" from consolidated output unless they are critical to the data's meaning.
13. For columns like 'confidence', preserve ALL values in order: e.g., "98;98;97;97;97" not just "98;97"

Example:
Input: 5 rows with confidence values: 98, 98, 97, 97, 97
Output: "confidence": "98;98;97;97;97"
